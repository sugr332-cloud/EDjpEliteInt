/**
 * Every alias of {@code fighter_attack_target} must say, in its own language, "attack my target" - the verb,
 * the possessive and the noun, all three.
 *
 * <p>WHY: this is the one fighter order that cannot be taken back. The fighter opens fire on whatever is
 * selected, and if that is a clean or allied ship the commander carries the bounty until they fly to an
 * Interstellar Factors contact and buy it off. Every other fighter order (recall, defend, hold fire, deploy)
 * is free to be guessed at; this one is not.
 *
 * <p>The failure this locks out was real. The group used to carry bare "attack", "fighter attack", "focus
 * target" and "focus on target". Those short, generic phrases are what the semantic reducer embeds, so they
 * pulled the command into the shortlist for anything vaguely combat-shaped - and the transcript "fight the
 * return to base" (a misheard "fighter return to base") scored inside the cutoff band and was settled as
 * {@code fighter_attack_target}. The fighter shot an ally.
 *
 * <p>Requiring the possessive keeps the phrases long and specific enough that a damaged transcript of a
 * <em>different</em> fighter order cannot reach them, and it is what the commander actually says when they
 * mean it. The cost, taken deliberately: the in-game order is labelled "Focus Target", and that wording no
 * longer routes here - the model may still pick the command from its description, but no alias hands it over.

     * Per language, the word stems an alias must all contain: the attack verb, the possessive, the target

     * "атакуй"/"атаковать"); a token counts when it starts with one of them.
     *
     * <p>IT additionally licenses "concentr-" ("concentrati sul mio bersaglio") as an attack verb, at the
     * Italian localizer's request. It is the only locale that renders the in-game "Focus Target" wording, and
     * it is safe here only because it keeps the possessive and the noun: no other Italian fighter order
     * contains "mio" or "bersaglio", so a damaged transcript of one cannot reach it. A bare "concentrati sul
     * bersaglio" would be the phrase that caused the incident above, and must not be added.
