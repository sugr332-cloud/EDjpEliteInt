/**
 * {@code Bindings.GameCommand} carries the whole of Elite's control set, but only the {@code DRIVEN}
 * entries are the ones EliteIntel presses itself, and only those are what the startup missing-binding
 * warning speaks about (see {@code BindingsMonitor#requiredGameBindings()}).
 *
 * <p>That flag has to stay in step with the code by hand, and nothing at runtime notices when it does
 * not: a new command pressing an unflagged control simply never warns that the control is unbound, and
 * the commander finds out when the command silently does nothing. So the driven set is checked against
 * the constants the main sources actually name, read out of the source tree rather than listed here -
 * a hand-kept list would go stale the first time someone writes a command.
