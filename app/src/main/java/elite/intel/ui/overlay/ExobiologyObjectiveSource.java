/**
 * Projects the genuses still to sample in the current system into a HUD
 * objective.
 * <p>
 * This is a self-set objective, not a contract: a DSS turns up biological
 * signals and the sampling list is the commander's own to-do list. It is
 * therefore shown only when discovery announcements are on - the same switch
 * that decides whether the commander wants to hear about discoveries at all -
 * and it ranks below every committed task, so an accepted mission or a plotted
 * route always keeps the card. There is only room for one.
 * <p>
 * Every poll re-derives the card from stored state - the genuses a DSS wrote to
 * the body, less the samples the scans recorded - so the card is the same after a
 * restart as it was before one. The DSS itself needs no wiring: the poll that
 * follows it finds the body because the row now has genuses on it. The one thing
 * the derivation cannot recover is a survey that has been finished and sold, since
 * selling clears the samples; the body carries a completion flag for that case and
 * a flagged body never gets a card.
 * <p>
 * The card follows the commander rather than the scan: the body being stood on
 * wins, then a body with samples already started, then the rest in body order.
 * Everything else falls out of the same derivation - a sampled genus drops off
 * the card by itself, and the card disappears when the system's last genus is
 * sampled or when the commander jumps away.
