/**
 * The BindingsMonitor class is responsible for monitoring changes to
 * key bindings files in the specified directory and updating the internal
 * bindings map accordingly. It continuously monitors the target directory
 * for file events and processes changes to ensure the bindings remain up to
 * date.
 * <p>
 * This class relies on the {@link KeyBindingsParser} to parse the contents of
 * key
 * bindings files and determine the mapping of actions to key bindings.
 * <p>
 * Features:
 * - Monitors a directory for changes to "*.binds" files.
 * - Automatically reloads and parses bindings when a new or modified file is
 * detected.
 * - Provides access to the current bindings map.
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety:
 * - This class uses synchronization to ensure thread-safe access to start and
 * stop
 * monitoring operations.
 * <p>
 * Logging:
 * - Uses SLF4J for logging to provide information on status, errors, and events
 * during monitoring.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions:
 * - Captures and logs IOExceptions, InterruptedExceptions, and other unexpected
 * errors
 * during the monitoring process.
