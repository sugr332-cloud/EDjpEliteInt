/**
 * "The organics here are already sampled" - the one thing about a body the journal cannot tell us.
 *
 * <p>The game remembers every organism a commander has ever logged; the journal does not report it.
 * A commander who sampled a body before installing this app therefore has a body the game will not
 * let them scan again and we believe is untouched, and no event will ever arrive to settle it. The
 * commander is the only source, so they get to say it: this records
 * {@link LocationDto#setBioScansCompleted(boolean)} by hand, which is what the overlay card, the
 * survey briefing and the exobiology queries all read.
 *
 * <p><b>One command with a state rather than a mark/unmark pair.</b> Two commands this close in
 * meaning cannot be told apart by the semantic reducer - it is the sibling problem that collapsed
 * ten carrier queries into three - and every phrase that reached the model would be a coin toss
 * between them. As a single boolean the reflex owns it outright: each alias pins its own literal
 * {@code state}, so "the bio scans here are already done" and "undo the bio scan mark" dispatch
 * deterministically without the model being consulted at all.
 *
 * <p>Not flagged dangerous, on the same licence as hardpoints: it is reversible by its own other
 * half, self-guarding (offered and executed only at a body with biology on it), and it names the
 * body it acted on out loud, so a misfire is both obvious and one sentence away from undone.
