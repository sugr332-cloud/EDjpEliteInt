 * Takes the playlist back to its first track.

 * commander left off, which is right nearly always and wrong exactly when they want the album, or the
 * audiobook, from the beginning again. Neither phrasing can stand in for the other, and the playlist now
 * rolls round on its own at the end, so this is the only way back to the top by voice.
