/**
 * Silences the music without losing the commander's place in it.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why "stop the music" is aliased here rather than to the transport's stop.</b> Spoken, "stop" means
 * "stop playing", not "go back to the beginning". A commander three quarters of the way through an
 * audiobook chapter who says "stop the music" and later "play music" expects the chapter to continue, and
 * would be badly served by starting it again. The Stop button on the Jukebox tab still rewinds, because
 * there the commander can see exactly what it did and press play with the track still selected.
