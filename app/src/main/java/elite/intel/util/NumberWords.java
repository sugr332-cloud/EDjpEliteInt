/**
 * A number written the way it is said aloud, in one of the languages we ship - 1320 as
 * "one thousand three hundred twenty", "eintausenddreihundertzwanzig", "mil trezentos e vinte".
 *
 * <p><b>Why words at all.</b> Every figure the app speaks goes through a TTS engine, and a number handed
 * over as digits is formatted by the reader's locale first: 45132120 reaches the voice as "45,132,120" in
 * English and "45.132.120" in German, Italian and Portuguese, where the group separator is read as a decimal
 * point. Spelling the number out removes the separator from the problem entirely.
 *
 * <p><b>Why ICU and not our own rules.</b> Spelling is where the languages stop agreeing. German inverts and
 * runs together ("fünfundvierzig"), French counts in twenties ("quatre-vingt-dix-sept"), Italian elides
 * ("ventotto"), Spanish contracts the twenties ("veintidós") and the Iberian and Slavic hundreds are
 * irregular words rather than "three" plus "hundred" ("trescientos", "триста"). The composition templates
 * that used to do this could express none of it, so German heard "vierzig fünf" and Russian
 * "три сотен двадцать". The rules now come from CLDR.
 *
 * <p>The mirror of {@link SpokenNumbers}, which reads a number back out of what the commander said.
