/**
 * Where a ship with no fuel scoop can go to refuel: the nearest station offering the Refuel service that
 * this particular ship can actually land on.
 *
 * <p>WHY this exists next to the commodity search: fuel is not a market good. It is bought at the station
 * services menu, so no commodity filter finds it and no market has it in stock - the question is only
 * whether the station offers {@link #REFUEL_SERVICE}, which Spansh records per station.
 *
 * <p>WHY the pad rule is applied here and not by Spansh: a ship fits any pad its own size or bigger, so a
 * medium ship wants "medium OR large", and Spansh's three pad counts are separate filters that AND together.
 * See {@link #padFilters}: a large ship is one search, a medium ship is two searches merged, and a small ship
 * needs no pad filter at all because every dockable station has some pad it fits on. The counts are then
 * re-checked on each hit through {@link ShipPadSizes#canDock}, which is what actually decides.
 *
 * <p>WHY fleet carriers are not offered: a carrier's recorded position is only where Spansh last saw it and
 * its owner can switch docking or refuelling off at will. A commander short of fuel is the last person who
 * can afford to jump somewhere and find nothing there, so only stations that stay put are named.
